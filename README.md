# Bank-Api
This is a small project in order to learn and practice my file handling capabilities and developing them, it is not a secure method nor very optimised but an interesting project 

You will need bcrypt in order to run the code and create files for storing the bank accounts and a hash table (the formatting is very important as the whole file handling is based on stric file formats)
Check the files to copy the format
